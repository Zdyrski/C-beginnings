# C-beginnings

Here are my 2 small projects from the time when i started my journey with programming (C++)

## Polynomial regression
In this project i visualized principle of polynomial regression using C++ language(it's not perfect, but works :) ).
It's simple.

1. Pick number of points (their x,y are generated randomly (x:0-1920;  y:(0-555)+300).
2. Pick power to which polynomial should regress.
3. Effect

## Draw fractals
Here I simply draw various fractals, you can also design your own.

1. Pick one of several prepared or design your own fractal.
2. Pick number of iterations, length of one segment(in pixels) and if it should draw slowly or not.
3. Effect

Note. Drawing starts from center of a screen so it can sometimes go off it.
